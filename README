Phprop CakePHP Plugin

phprop-plugin is a cakephp plugin to manage multilanguage html content based on a json properties file

this is not a PO file manager
this is not a Translatable Behaviour replacement

this is a user managed multilanguage and html content alternative for small projects (file bottleneck is present)
